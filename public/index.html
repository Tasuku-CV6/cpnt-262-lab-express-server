            <h3>Character 1</h3>
            <p>
              Takanashi Hoshino is the president of the Abydos Student Council
              and the only third-year of Abydos High School, and the current
              chairwoman for the Countermeasures Commitee.

            <img src="images/Mika_Portrait.webp" alt="Misono Mika" />
            <h3>Character 2</h3>
            <p>
              A member of Trinity's student council, Tea Party, and one of its
              three student council presidents. She is the childhood friend of
              Nagisa and has known her for ten years. She calls her Nagi-chan.
              Unlike the other two presidents of the Tea Party, she isn't
              particularly bright when it comes to politics, but her strength is
              not to be underestimated.

            <h3>Character 3</h3>
            <p>
              An unparalleled expert in guerilla tactics, Saori can stay calm
              under pressure and doesn't hesitate to use whatever means
              necessary to accomplish her objective. Sometimes, though, she
              displays a seemingly contradictory side of herself, one that isn't
              afraid to let emotions surge forth in the heat of the moment.
